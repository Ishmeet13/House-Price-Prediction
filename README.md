![ML Pipeline Animation](https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction/raw/main/assets/pipeline_animation.gif)

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for house price prediction that goes beyond standard implementations by focusing on thorough data understanding, structured processing, and production-ready MLOps practices. Interactive visualizations and animations help stakeholders understand the model's decision-making process.

## Key Differentiators

While house price prediction is a common ML project, our implementation stands out through:

### 1. Comprehensive Data Research Approach
- **Deep Exploratory Data Analysis**: Instead of superficial EDA, we conduct thorough statistical analysis to truly understand underlying patterns and relationships
- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: We incorporate real estate domain expertise into our feature engineering process
- **Rigorous Assumption Testing**: All statistical assumptions are explicitly verified before proceeding with modeling

### 2. Structured Data Processing Pipeline
- **EDA-Driven Preprocessing**: Our preprocessing steps directly implement findings from our exploratory analysis
- **Iterative Validation**: Continuous validation throughout the pipeline ensures data quality at every step
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Custom feature transformations based on real estate valuation principles
- **Interactive Data Transformations**: Animated visualizations show how data flows through each preprocessing stage

### 3. Beyond Basic Modeling
- **Assumption-Aware Modeling**: Models are selected and refined based on how well they maintain statistical validity
- **Interpretability Focus**: Explainable AI techniques help understand prediction factors for stakeholder trust
- **Ensemble Methodologies**: Multiple model approaches combined for robust predictions
- **Animated Feature Importance**: Dynamic visualizations show how different features impact predictions across various property types

### 4. Production-Ready MLOps Implementation
- **ZenML Pipeline Orchestration**: Fully reproducible pipeline with proper dependency management
- **MLflow Experiment Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of all experiments for comparison and audit
- **Automated Testing & Deployment**: CI/CD integration ensures model quality before deployment
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Systems to detect model drift and performance degradation in production
- **Pipeline Visualization**: Animated dashboard showing real-time pipeline execution status and metrics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- ZenML
- MLflow

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize ZenML
zenml init

# Set up the stack with MLflow
zenml stack register house-price-stack \
    -a default \
    -o mlflow \
    -e default

# Register the stack as active
zenml stack set house-price-stack
```

### Running the Pipeline

```bash
# Run the full pipeline
python run_pipeline.py

# Or run individual steps
python run_pipeline.py --steps data_ingestion,preprocessing
```

### Accessing MLflow UI

```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri ./mlflow
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:5000

### Viewing Interactive Visualizations

The project includes several interactive visualizations and animations:

1. **Pipeline Flow Animation**: View how data flows through the entire pipeline
   ```bash
   python -m src.visualizations.pipeline_animation
   ```

2. **Feature Importance Explorer**: Interactive visualization of feature importance
   ```bash
   python -m src.visualizations.feature_explorer
   ```

3. **Model Performance Dashboard**: Animated dashboard showing model metrics across different segments
   ```bash
   python -m src.visualizations.performance_dashboard
   ```

## Model Performance

Our current model achieves:
- RMSE: X on validation data
- MAE: Y on validation data
- R²: Z on validation data

Performance metrics are tracked in MLflow for all experiments.
